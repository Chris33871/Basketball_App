### Sessions

It's summer and people want to play outside. Before you leave the house you want to know how many people will be playing at your local court. This is where sessions come in. A session is just a 30-minute timeframe in which individuals will be playing on the court. Users can either create or join sessions made by other players. They simply enter the location and the time at which they will be at the basketball court. This way before leaving to play you can easily check if it will be an entertaining and competitive busy day at the court or a slow uneventful day. With this information, users can avoid wasting time travelling to their favourite court only to find it empty.

### Create or Join Games

Users can create or join private games. A user can list their game on the website to allow others to join them for a game of basketball

### Teams

Users can choose to join public or private (work in progress) teams to get access to team information such as who's playing where general news and the ability to socialise and make friends with people who have the same interests as you.

Users can choose to join the biggest and most famous team in town, attempt to grow their own community by creating a new public team or simply create a private team for just them and their friends.
